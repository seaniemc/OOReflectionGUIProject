##Introduction

This program utiles the Reflection API, to calculate the Positional Stability(1) of each class contained with in a Jar file. The stability metric is calculate by finding both the Efferent(ce) and Afferent(ca) couplings of each class and then performing the following calculation, 1 = ce/ce + ca. In order to find find the dependancies and different couplings of each class, we used the Reflection API. The application was built using the MVC design pattern. The application uses the Swing libaray to create GUI's, which the user interacts with.
